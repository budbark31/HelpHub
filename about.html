      <h1>About HelpHub</h1>

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>HelpHub was founded in 2018 by a diverse group of social entrepreneurs who shared one common belief: connecting people with charitable organizations should be simple, transparent, and impactful. What started as a small community project has grown into a platform that helps thousands of donors find causes they care about and make a difference.</p>
      
      <p>Our journey began when our founders witnessed the aftermath of a natural disaster and saw how many people wanted to help but didn't know how to connect with legitimate organizations that could use their support effectively. This inspired the creation of HelpHub—a bridge between generous individuals and trustworthy charitable organizations.</p>
      
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>At HelpHub, our mission is to break down barriers between willing helpers and worthy causes. We believe that everyone has something valuable to contribute—whether it's time, skills, or financial support. By creating a user-friendly platform that vets and showcases reputable charitable organizations, we make it easier for individuals to find ways to contribute to their communities and support causes they care deeply about.</p>
      
      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>HelpHub serves as a centralized platform where:</p>

        <li><strong>We Verify</strong>: Every organization on our platform undergoes thorough vetting to ensure legitimacy and transparency in how they use donations.</li>
        <li><strong>We Educate</strong>: We provide information about different causes, their impact, and how your contribution makes a difference.</li>
        <li><strong>We Facilitate</strong>: Our platform makes it easy to donate, volunteer, or partner with organizations in just a few clicks.</li>
